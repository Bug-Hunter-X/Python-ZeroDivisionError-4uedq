# Python ZeroDivisionError
This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Python: ZeroDivisionError.

The `bug.py` file contains code that attempts to divide by zero, resulting in a ZeroDivisionError.

The `bugSolution.py` file provides a solution by implementing error handling to gracefully handle cases where the divisor is zero.
